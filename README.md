# Burger Database

This is a simple node.js app I wrote using Node and Express to perform MYSQL queries. A live version of the site can be found [here](https://immense-sands-70222.herokuapp.com/)

The app allows the user to add burgers, and eddit their "devoured" status by clicking on them. It also includes a delete function. Thus, it is capable of CRUD operations.
